## What is this?
A microservice to get the distance between 2 UK postcodes. Built for my friends at [Jerk Off BBQ](https://www.jerkoffbbq.com/).

Feel free to use it for any non-evil purpose!

## How does it work?
Uses plain Ruby rather than a framework to keep the size down and allow deployment on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)'s generous free tier.

CSS by [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Where does the data come from?
[Source: Office for National Statistics licensed under the Open Government Licence v3.0](https://www.getthedata.com/open-postcode-geo)

## Any limitations?
Excludes Northern Ireland due to licensing requirements.
